    "The function above is a simplified implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory. Using historical data for expected returns and covariance, the code estimates what combination of stock weightings would produce a portfolio with an optimal balance of risk and return by looking at its Sharpe ratio. It accounts for diversification inherently due to its use of the covariance matrix of returns for all the stocks. It differs from a more advanced approach by assuming no risk-free rate and using a Monte Carlo simulation approach to create the set of portfolios used rather than using an algorithm to directly compute an efficient frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "As our goal is to beat the market, we are not risk-averse in our strategy. Hence, instead of using MPT traditionally and choosing a portfolio with the best return for a specific risk, we choose the portfolio with the best return proportional to risk in general to maximize our potential gains. We decided to use this simplified MPT to ensure our final portfolio would end up being diversified as well as account for historical data, as we do have other approaches that simulate the future instead. The results of running this function are also an ordered list of stocks with a definitive hierarchy relative to each other. This is beneficial in choosing which stocks to put in our final portfolio later, as it gives us an idea of which stocks are definitively the best, as opposed to something like CAPM, which only produces a list of stocks that satisfy a condition, but with no further information on how they perform against each other."

    "**Algorithm Explanation:**\n",
    "This use of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was chosen to build a list of stocks that would be expected to beat the market. Essentially, what the algorithm does is predict how much extra return someone would expect from a stock, given its level of risk compared to the market. The addition of Rf in the formula adds the minimum return expected for taking no market risk; the baseline return. The \n",
    "(Rm−Rf) is essentially the premium/additional return that an investor gets for investing in the market versus a risk-free asset (Rf). The final, and most important aspect, is the multiplication of Beta, which adjusts the market risk premium for the specific stock's level of risk. A higher Beta indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market, so it is expected to earn a higher return to compensate for that increased risk. Beta is calculated by looking at the daily returns of a specific stock and the market index (S&P 500) and examining the covariance of the two returns. It’s then divided by the market variance to create Beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "When a stock is more volatile than the market, it reacts more strongly to market movements. For example, if the market were to go up 1%, the stock might go up 2%. We depend on this higher sensitivity to market movements to outperform the market. However, the main assumption of this method is that the market is going up, not down. If the market were to decline, the stock would underperform in this scenario and perform even worse than the market. This ties back to the concepts in Chapter 16 readings regarding risk and return. The higher the risk, the higher the expected return. If we wanted guaranteed returns, we could invest in a risk-free asset like government bonds. However, to outperform the market, we need to take on more risk than the market itself. The use of CAPM helps create a risk-adjusted return for a stock, which we compare to the S&P 500's return and store the stock if its expected return is higher."

    "The code above does not perform many calculations; however, some thinking still went into it. The main idea behind this section was to divide and distribute the funds equally among all stocks in the portfolio rather than analyzing different weights for each stock. There are strengths and weaknesses to this strategy. We believed this approach would automatically diversify the portfolio by treating all stocks equally, reducing the risk associated with any single stock. This negates *non-systematic (non-market) risk*. It also reduced the need for extensive analysis, allowing more time for our algorithm simulations to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a drawback is the missed potential for risk/return optimization and specific industry diversification. Some of our algorithms use risk to assess if a stock is more volatile than the S&P 500 index. For instance, we might find that the tech industry is much more volatile than others. In that case, it would be best to distribute the weight based on industry rather than across all stocks, as more tech stocks might appear in the portfolio. These stocks would likely be correlated due to their complementary nature within the same industry. However, our method prioritized a straightforward approach by diversifying between stocks rather than industries, thus leaving more focus on the algorithms selecting the stocks. This also ties back to Chapter 9, many of the stocks in the S&P500 index are controlled by a few stocks due to the equity and weight distribution of the index. By only investing in these high risk stocks, equally, we plan for all of them to out preform."
